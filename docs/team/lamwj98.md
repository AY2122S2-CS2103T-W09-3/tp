### Project: Expense Expert

Expense Expert is a desktop expense tracking application used for tracking one's personal expenses. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about ~10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **Filtering expense(s)**:

  - What it does: Allows users to filter expense(s) based on date (can be specific date or by month), category, or a combination of both.
  - Justification: Users may want to know where they had spent money on specific date, specific month or even specific category.
