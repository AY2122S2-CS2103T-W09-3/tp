### Project: Expense Expert

Expense Expert - Level 3 is a desktop Expense management application used for managing personal finance. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to set expense categories and tag them to expenses.

  - What it does: allows the user to defined expense categories. viewing expense categories can be done using the listCat command and defined using the addCat command.
  - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can categorise their expenses.
  - Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation challenging as it required building upon the existing model and making design decisions with future features in mind.
