### Project: Expense Expert

Expense Expert is a desktop expense tracking application used for tracking one's personal expenses. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about ~10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

**New Feature**:
  - **Edit the amount of money a person owes**

    - What it does: allows the user to edit the amount of money owed by an existing person.
    - Justification: this feature makes it easier to manage the people who owe money.
    - This feature was facilitated by the 'update' command.
    - The command's parsing and testing was handled as well.
