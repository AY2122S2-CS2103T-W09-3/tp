### Project: Expense Expert

Expense Expert is a desktop expense tracking application used for tracking one's personal expenses. The user interacts
with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about ~10 kLoC.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**:
  - **Add a new person to the list of people who owe you money**
  
    - What it does: A new list was created to keep track of the people who owe the user money. This feature allows the user to
      to add people to it with the amount they owe them.
    - This was a new dimension to the application, which extended the capabilities of our app from just being an expense tracker
      to a financial manager.
    - This is done by the "person" command, and the parsing as well as testing was handled.

- **New Feature**: 
  - **Removing a person from the list of people who had paid back the owed money**

    - What it does: From the list of people who owed the user money, this feature enables the removal of people who have
      paid the said money and hence, are to be removed
    - This was done by the "paid" command, and its parsing and testing were handled as well
