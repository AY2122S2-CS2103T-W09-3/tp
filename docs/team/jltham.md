### Project: Expense Expert

Expense Expert is a desktop expense trackign application used for tracking one's personal expenses. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about ~10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

  - Justification: Users may want to set a budget for themselves so they do not overspend.
  - Highlights: _(to be added soon)_

- **New Feature**: Viewing the monthly budget previously set

  - What it does: Allows users to view the budget they set previously on the GUI.
