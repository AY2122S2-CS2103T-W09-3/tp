Expense Expert is a **desktop app for keeping track of your expenses, and managing your budget, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Expense Expert can get your expense management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

   Some example commands you can try:

   - **`list`** : Lists all the expenses you have recorded.

   - **`add`** `d/Lunch at VivoCity $/12.95 c/Food` : Adds a new expense of $12.95 for Lunch at Vivocity to your list of expenses

   - **`delete`** `3` : Deletes the 3rd expense shown in the current list.

   - **`quit`** : Exits the app for you.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `d/DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `d/Dinner at ECP`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `d/DESCRIPTION [c/CATEGORY]` can be used as `d/Dinner at ECP c/Food` or as `d/Dinner at ECP`.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `d/DESCRIPTION $/AMOUNT`, `$/AMOUNT d/DESCRIPTION` is also acceptable.

- If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `$/12.99 $/13.50`, only `$/13.50` will be taken.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list` and `quit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
