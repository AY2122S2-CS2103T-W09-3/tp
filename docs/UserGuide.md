Expense Expert is a **desktop app for keeping track of your expenses, and managing your budget, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Expense Expert can get your expense management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `d/DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `d/Dinner at ECP`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `d/DESCRIPTION [c/CATEGORY]` can be used as `d/Dinner at ECP c/Food` or as `d/Dinner at ECP`.

- Items in brackets means at least one of the components must be present. <br>
- e.g. `(ft/DATE) (c/CATEGORY)` can be used as `ft/2022-03`, `ft/2022-03 c/Transport` or `c/Transport`.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `d/DESCRIPTION a/AMOUNT`, `a/AMOUNT d/DESCRIPTION` is also acceptable.

- If a parameter is expected only once in the command but is instead specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `a/12.99 a/13.50`, only `a/13.50` will be taken.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
